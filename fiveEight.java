/*
 (Find the highest score) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the num-
ber of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the name
of the student with the highest score. Use the next() method in the Scanner
class to read a name, rather than using the nextLine() method. Assume that the
number of students is at least 1.
